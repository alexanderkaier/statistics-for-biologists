# Distributions

## What are probability distributions

## Why do we need probability distributions
<!--
When working with probability distributions, the first differentiation you have to make is between _continuous_ and _discrete_ distributions
-->

## Distributions in R:
<!--
Explain the syntax of distros in R (e.g. dnorm, rnorm, pnorm, qnorm)
-->

## Continuous probabality distributions
<!--
In this section i will present to you the most prominent and widely applicable continuous distributions.
-->

### Uniform distribution

### Normal distribution
<!--
Tell something about the central limit theorem and the extraordinary position of the normal distribution.
-->

## Discrete distributions

### Bernouille distribution

### Binomial distribution

\begin{equation}
  P(X=k~|~n,~p) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}

And here in Equation \@ref(eq:binom), we see the function for the binomial distribution.
